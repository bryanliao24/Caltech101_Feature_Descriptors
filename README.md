# Caltech101_Feature_Descriptors

-- This is the REANME file  --

- The development environment for this job is Windows 10
- Python 3.8 and Pytorch, torchvision, etc. are used.
- Developed with jupyter notedbook

*** For Task1, you can directly follow the cell order in jupyter notebook, and for given image, you can directly input the image ID to compute the 5 feature vectors and get the feature descriptors.

*** For Task2, the feature descriptors from all 5 models are stored in .... /Output/Task2_Pickle_file folder. There are 5 files.

*** For Task3. all similar images generated by query image are stored in . /Output/{Image_id = "?" .pdf}. The defined similarity distance method can be found in jupyter notebook's cell.

*************************** 
For Task1, you can execute Task1 directly 
and the program will ask you to enter an input field in the command line for the feature descriptor you want to compute, 
and when you enter it, it will print out color moment, HOG, AVGpool, layer3, and FC in sequence.
